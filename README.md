pm-pluigin-buildmode
====================

Adds a command that will enable build/destroy mode for users.

/buildmode <user> [on|off]

If on/off is left off it will report the users current setting.

Default user setting can be set in the config.json file. 

User buildmode states are stored in userstate.json.

Any questions let me know!
